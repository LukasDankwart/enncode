[NODE 4]: Slice_4
     [PASSED]: Extracting current subgraph was successful, stored at onnxgurobi/tests/vnncomp/cctsdb_yolo/subgraphs\node_004_Slice_4.onnx. 
     [FAILED]: Compatibility is missing. Subgraph has unsupported node type! 
          Parser for operator 'Slice' is not supported. 

 Note: - Furthermore, the original model contains following unsupported operation types, which are likely to cause further incompatibility: 
['Squeeze', 'Resize', 'ScatterND', 'Gather', 'Clip', 'Slice', 'Expand', 'Shape', 'ArgMax', 'Min', 'ConstantOfShape', 'Transpose', 'Range', 'Cast', 'Equal', 'Max', 'Where']
 (Please see documentation for currently supported node-operations)
