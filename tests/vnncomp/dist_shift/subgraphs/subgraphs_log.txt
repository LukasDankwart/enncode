     [PASSED]: Extracting current subgraph was successful, stored at onnxgurobi/tests/vnncomp/dist_shift/subgraphs\node_003_Sigmoid_6.onnx. 
     [FAILED]: Compatibility is missing. Subgraph has unsupported node type! 
          Parser for operator 'Sigmoid' is not supported. 

 Note: - Furthermore, the original model contains following unsupported operation types, which are likely to cause further incompatibility: 
['Sigmoid']
