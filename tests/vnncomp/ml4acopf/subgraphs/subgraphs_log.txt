     [PASSED]: Extracting current subgraph was successful, stored at onnxgurobi/tests/vnncomp/ml4acopf/subgraphs\node_011__layers.7_Slice.onnx. 
     [FAILED]: Compatibility is missing. Subgraph has unsupported node type! 
          Parser for operator 'Slice' is not supported. 

 Note: - Furthermore, the original model contains following unsupported operation types, which are likely to cause further incompatibility: 
['Expand', 'Cos', 'ConstantOfShape', 'Gather', 'Transpose', 'Where', 'Equal', 'Neg', 'Sin', 'Sigmoid', 'Slice', 'Pow']
 (Please see documentation for currently supported node-operations)
