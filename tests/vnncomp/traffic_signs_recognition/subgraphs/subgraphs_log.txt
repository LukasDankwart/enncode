[NODE 0]: sequential_10/quant_conv2d_20/QuantConv2D__185
     [PASSED]: Extracting current subgraph was successful, stored at onnxgurobi/tests/vnncomp/traffic_signs_recognition/subgraphs\node_000_sequential_10_quant_conv2d_20_QuantConv2D__185.onnx. 
     [FAILED]: Compatibility is missing. Subgraph has unsupported node type! 
          Parser for operator 'Transpose' is not supported. 

 Note: - Furthermore, the original model contains following unsupported operation types, which are likely to cause further incompatibility: 
['Softmax', 'Sign', 'Transpose']
 (Please see documentation for currently supported node-operations)
