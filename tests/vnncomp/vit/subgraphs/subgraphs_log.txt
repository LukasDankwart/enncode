Log-file from analysing of onnxgurobi/tests/vnncomp/vit/ibp_3_3_8_modified.onnx. 
 
[NODE 0]: /0/Shape
     [PASSED]: Extracting current subgraph was successful, stored at onnxgurobi/tests/vnncomp/vit/subgraphs\node_000__0_Shape.onnx. 
     [FAILED]: Compatibility is missing. Subgraph has unsupported node type! 
          Parser for operator 'Shape' is not supported. 

 Note: - Furthermore, the original model contains following unsupported operation types, which are likely to cause further incompatibility: 
['ReduceMean', 'Slice', 'Transpose', 'Shape', 'ConstantOfShape', 'Gather', 'Softmax']
 (Please see documentation for currently supported node-operations)
